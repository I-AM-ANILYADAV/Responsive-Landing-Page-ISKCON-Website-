        The <b>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)</b>, otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement, includes five hundred major centers, temples and rural communities, nearly one hundred affilated vegetarian restaurants, thousands of namahattas or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of congregational members worldwide. Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in New York City in 1966. <br>

ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradāya, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gītā and the Bhagavat Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”. <br>

God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for deliverance: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. <br>

    Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “a tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind.” In the 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that, “It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world.” <br>

ISKCON’s founder, Srila Prabhupada, has drawn appreciation from scholars and religious leaders alike for his remarkable achievement in presenting India’s Vaishnava spiritual culture in a relevant manner to contemporary Western and worldwide audiences. <br>

Members of ISKCON practice bhakti-yoga in their homes and also worship in temples. They also promote bhakti-yoga, or Krishna Consciousness, through festivals, the performing arts, yoga seminars, public chanting, and the distribution of the society’s literatures. ISKCON members have also opened hospitals, schools, colleges, eco-villages, free food distribution projects, and other institutions as a practical application of the path of devotional yoga. <br>

            Lord Krishna is worshipped as the supreme God and the source of all the Almighty's avatars, <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            Abhaya Caranaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Ji is considered the spiritual mentor and guru of the

             India since the late 15th century. Gudiya Vaishnavism's major branch is ISKCON.

            His Divine Grace <b>A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</b>, Founder-Acharya of International Society <br>
            for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), was born Abhay Charan De, on the 1 September 1896, in <br>
            Calcutta. In 1922 he met His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddanta Sarasvati Thakur, Founder of Gaudiya <br> 
            Math, who requested Abhay to broadcast Vedic knowledge in the English medium. In 1933, at <br> 
            Allahabad, Abhay was formally initiated and made it his life ambition to expound the Vedic <br>
            conclusion that real freedom means liberation from the miseries of material life : birth, <br>
            death, old age and disease, a state that can be permanently attained by awakening one’s pure <br>
            love for God, Krishna-prema or Krishna-bhakti.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the ensuing years Abhay Charanaravinda (his initiated name), wrote a commentary on the <br>
            Bhagavad-gita. In 1944 he started the Back to Godhead magazine, which to this day is being <br>
            continued by his disciples.
            </p>
            <p>
            In recognition of his philosophical knowledge and devotion the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society honored <br>
            him with the title Bhaktivedanta in 1947. Following his retirement from married life, <br>
            A.C. Bhaktivedanta traveled to Vrindavan where he lived in the humble surrounding of the <br>
            Radha Damodar temple. In 1959 he took the sannyasa order of life and, as A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, <br>
            started his work on the multi-volume translation and commentary of the 18,000 verse Srimad <br>
            Bhagavatam.In 1965, at the age of 69, when ordinary persons are thinking of retirement, he went to the United States 
            to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master and founded ISKCON.

         The goal of life according to the Vaishnava, or Krishna conscious, teaching is to awaken within each soul knowledge of their original spiritual nature, thus bringing the individual to the platform of God consciousness, or devotional service to God. <br>

         Thus for ISKCON, education is an integral part of its communities. Temples around the world sponsor adult educational programs as well as Sunday Schools for children. ISKCON also has a wide spectrum of online and classroom courses ranging from the fundamentals of spirituality to the advanced concepts of Gaudiya Vaishnavism; from communications to developing spiritually focused family life. <br>

         Srila Prabhupada wanted to provide opportunities for all people to gain a systematic understanding of the profound Vaishnava philosophy. Thus, his followers have developed systematic studies of the texts fundamental to Krishna consciousness such as a preliminary Bhakti-sastri course that focuses on the famous Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gita and Sri Isopanisad along with later writings, the Bhakti-rasamrita Sindu (Nectar of Devotion) and Upadeshamrita (Nectar of Instruction). <br>

         ISKCON also offers short term programs on leadership and management, conflict resolution, discipleship, etc. ISKCON and its affiliates thus enable students to improve their academic and vocational potentials, apply Vedic principles to contemporary lifestyles, and make positive contributions in society. <br>

         ISKCON also has two affiliated colleges,</b> the Bhaktivedanta College in Belgium and the Bhaktivedanta College in Hungary</b>. Both offer full degrees in affiliation with government and academic accrediting boards. The Bhaktivedanta College in Belgium has collaborative partnership with the University of Chester in the United Kingdom offering a Theology and Religious Studies degree program. Hungary’s Bhaktivedanta College for Religious Science (BCRS) is the the first fully accredited Vaishnava Theology College in Europe. It has over 300 students. <br>

         In recent years, ISKCON affiliates have parterned with the UK Government in establishing a series of Krishna Avanti Schools, the first state-funded Vedic, or Hindu, schools in United Kingdom. ISKCON also has several affiliated schools for children in India, including Vrindavana, Utar Pradesh, and Mayapura, West Bengal. These programs and others internationally are designed to give children the opportunity to grow to their highest potential — academically, socially, emotionally, and physically — all the while developing their spiritual identities in a nurturing and positive environment. <br>

         In all these programs ISKCON promotes an inclusive worldview through a variety of cultural studies and experiences. We foster an understanding that our essential spiritual self transcends all designations of race, ethnicity, gender, and economic status—and that ultimately we are all children of God.

         <b>Janmastami </b> – the birth of Lord Krishna – is one of the biggest events of the year. It is the Vaishnava equivalent of Christmas in that devotees celebrate God’s advent 5,000 years ago into this material world from the spiritual. The name Krishna means “All-Attractive.” Lord Krishna exhibits six opulences in full: beauty, knowledge, fame, wealth, strength, and humility. Thus, He is worshipped as “The Supreme All-Attractive Personality of Godhead.”
        Today, Janmastami is celebrated across the globe with unparalleled grandeur at all ISKCON centers. All day performances of music, drama, dance and chanting in glorification of the enchanting pastimes of the Lord, lead up the midnight hour at which Lord Krishna appeared. A midnight service accompanied by kirtan and dancing is followed by a multi-course vegetarian feast for all.

         <b> Rath Yatra-Festival of Chariots</b> With the exception of Kumbha Mela, the Rath Yatra traditionally held in Puri, India attracts the largest gathering of pilgrims in India. During this festival, the beautifully bedecked Deities of Jagannath (Lord of the universe) , Baladev (Krishna’s brother) and Subhadra (Krishna’s sister) are taken out on three giant chariots specially constructed for the parade.

         According to scriptures, even though Krishna became a great King of Dwarka, his childhood was spent amongst simple cowherd boys and girls in the village of Vrindavana. This mood of wanting to bring back Krishna to the playful pastimes of Vrindavana signifies the inner meaning of Rath Yatra. When devotees pull the ropes of the cart, it symbolizes the pulling of the Lord into our hearts.
        
         In the late 1960s, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada inaugurated this joyous event in North America. With roots steeped in spiritual traditions, the festival is now celebrated in every major city around the world, including London, Paris, Durban, Sydney, Mumbai and New York. For instance , in Los Angeles, more than 50,000 people take part in the colorful walk, pulling three giant 40-foot tall chariots. Exhibitions and stage performances often accompany the parade, amidst melodious singing, chanting, drumming,dancing and feasting.

    <img src="c:\Users\HP\Downloads\ISKCON-Diwali.jpg" width="250"alt="ISKCON-Diwali"style ="float:left;margin-right: 20px;" >
         <b>Diwali</b>, or the Festival of Lights, marks the Hindu New Year, and is associated with many of the Supreme Lord’s pastimes on earth. Diwali is the best known of Vedic holidays and is today marked by events in places as varied as ISKCON temples and America’s White House.

         For ISKCON members, this day is most notable because it marks the return of Lord Rama, an incarnation of Krishna, to his kingdom of Ayodhya, after his defeat of the evil king Ravana. Rama was welcomed by all the citizens who lit lamps or dipas illuminating the sky for his joyous return. It also marks a day during Lord Krishna’s advent when He dispatched the demoniac Narakasura.

         Diwali thus signifies the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The festival also symbolizes a time for spiritual renewal by lighting a lamp within our own hearts for spiritual enlightenment and by welcoming the Lord into our lives. The festival is often celebrated with elaborate firework displays, lighting Diwali lamps and feasting.

        Bhakti Yoga

         Yoga is more than just a physical exercise. The word <b>“YOGA” </b>omes from the Sanskrit root Yuj which means to link up with, or combine. Bhakti is derived from the Sanskrit word bhaj, which means – loving service. Bhakti-yoga means to connect to the Supreme by means of loving devotional service. <br>

         The Bhagavad Gita, the core spiritual text for ISKCON, describes variety of yoga practices. Among them are karma-yoga (the practice of conscious action), jnana-yoga (philosophical study and contemplation), and hatha-yoga (the practice of yoga-asanas and breathing exercises). <br>

         Today, some yoga practitioners consider the physical benefits of yoga to be the end in themselves. But according to the traditional yoga systems, physical exercises are just one step on path of God realization. The Gita ultimately prescribes bhakti-yoga (the path of dedication and love) as the culmination of other yoga practices. Bhakti-yoga focuses on developing our dedication, service and love for the Divinity, Lord Krishna. <br>

         The path of bhakti-yoga is developed through a variety of activities. These include mantra meditation, or the chanting of the names of God. The chanting is done either individually on beads (japa) or in community by chanting mantras accompanied by music (kirtan). The study of sacred texts such as the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, associating with like-minded spiritual aspirants, eating sanctified vegetarian food, and living in a way that upholds the principles of truthfulness, mercy, austerity, and cleanliness, are all core practices for a life of follower of bhakti.

        God is a Person

         Even though God is widely recognized as the greatest person, His form and personality are not widely known about. Even many theists think that, in the ultimate issue, God is formless. Pictures of Lord Krishna playing a flute are commonly dismissed as quaint, mythological representations of the ineffable, faceless <b>“Divine.”</b> <br>

         However, there is overwhelming evidence suggesting that the Supreme Person is not abstract at all. In the Vedas—the oldest and most comprehensive of all world scriptures—one can discover that the Absolute Truth has both impersonal and personal aspects. His eternal, blissful, all-knowing, and all-attractive personality tends to remain hidden behind His all-pervasive majesty and overwhelming greatness. <br>

         Since everything in our experience has form and qualities, it makes sense that the source of all sources should also, to an infinite degree. As drops of ocean water have the ocean’s qualities in minute degree, our forms and personalities are infinitesimal samples of the infinite Supreme Person. <br>

         Vedic writings describe in detail the unlimited names, activities, opulences, and associates of the Supreme Person. Krishna (“all-attractive”) is how He’s referred to by those who are interested more in His supreme, transcendental personality than in His greatness.

         Books such as the Srimad-Bhagavatam and Brahma-samhita contain elaborate accounts of Krishna’s many attractive forms and activities, both in this temporary universe and in the world beyond.

        Meditation

         Meditation is a spiritual practice found in practically all religious and spiritual traditions, although the methods differ. <br>

         Traditional yogic systems employ complex meditation techniques, often working with different postures to align our external and subtle selves and focus our minds towards self-realization. To quiet the mind and provide a point of focus, yogis are advised to concentrate on upon mantras including Sanskrit syllables and the names of God. <br>

         The Vaishnava tradition recommends the chanting the names of God to be a particularly effective method of spiritual awakening, simultaneously opening us to an incredibly empowering experience. <br>

         In this system, <b>Meditation has three distinct forms: japa, kirtan and sankirtan</b>. In japa, the meditator individually and softly recites God’s name with the use of beads, similar to a rosary. Kirtan is a public meditation, in which one loudly sings the names of God accompanied by musical instruments. When performed in a group this is called sankirtan. <br>

         This entire process is centred around the recitation of the names of God. The prayer or mantra that ISKCON devotees repeat is called the Maha Mantra, or the “great mantra for deliverance.” It is made up of three words Hare, Krishna and Rama. Hare refers to God’s energy. Krishna and Rama refer to God as the all-attractive and all-powerful one who is the source of all pleasure. Repetition of this mantra awakens the soul and brings strength, peace and happiness. It ultimately connects us with Lord Krishna and reveals our original spiritual life of eternal bliss and knowledge. <br>

    <h2>
        Karma
    </h2>
    <p>
         Ever wondered why bad things happen to good people? Why we suffer? Why some days are awesome and others morose? If God exists, why does He keep quiet about it? The answer to all the above questions is karma. <br>

         Karma is one of those topics that many people know about, but few understand the intricacies of it. In literal terms, “karma” means <b>“Activity” </b>and the law of karma regulates the reactions to our activities. If we act in good, or pious ways, we reap good reactions. If we act in impious, sinful, or destructive ways, we reap bad reactions in the future. Christian theology explains, “As ye sow so ye shall ye reap” while in physics karma is expressed by Newton’s Law, “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” <br>
        
         Karmic reactions include not only things that happen to us, but determine our health, wealth, intelligence, physical appearance, and social status, as well as our personalities and inclinations. While we have some degree of freedom to choose our current actions, our choices are influenced by our natures, or personalities, which have developed from our previous actions. <br>
         
         Karma thus locks us up in a cycle of action and subsequent reaction. As long as we are in this cycle, we will experience both happiness and distress. Even if we act in a pious way, we destine ourselves to accept another material body at death to enjoy the reactions to our materially good actions. As long as we accept a material body we can not avoid the miseries of disease, old age, and death. <br>
        
         Fortunately karma is temporary. We can break free from its bonds by performing spiritual acts in service to Krishna. Such acts of devotion, or bhakti-yoga, purify the soul and gradually awaken our spiritual knowledge and innate love for Krishna. Thus, both our karma and our long-standing desire to enjoy life within the illusory material world—the root cause of our bondage—are destroyed. <br>
